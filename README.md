# High School Java Programming

This repository contains code for various Java programming assignments from my high school Java courses. Each assignment is contained in its own directory, with a README file that provides instructions for the assignment and a Java source file that contains the code for the assignment.

## Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, you'll need to have a Java development environment set up on your computer. You can download the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official [Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

Simply open the Java source file for the assignment you're interested in and compile and run it using your Java development environment. If the file is marked as `ROBUSTA`, you will need to download and use the [Robusta flavour](https://github.com/FrenchTechLead/robusta) in order to compile it properly.

Once you have a Java development environment set up, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/mart1d4/Programmation.git`
